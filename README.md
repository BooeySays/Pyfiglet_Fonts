# Pyfiglet_Fonts
FLF figlet font files converted from the TLF files.

**DESCRIPTION:**

I wasn't able to use the tlf files with pyfiglet, so I started converting a bunch of the TLF files, into FLFs. THEN!, because I have no life, I started messing around the the files and created a bunch of colored versions of the same files.

**FILES CONVERTED:**

smmono9.tlf -> smmono9.flf
                - red.smmono9.flf
                - green.smmono9.flf
                - yellow.smmono9.flf
                - blue.smmono9.flf
                - magenta.smmono9.flf
                - cyan.smmono9.flf
